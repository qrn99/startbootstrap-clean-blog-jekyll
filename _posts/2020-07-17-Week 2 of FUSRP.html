<p> It’s been two weeks since FUSRP started! I didn’t have the chance to write my
    thoughts down until tonight. </p>

<p> For the first few weeks, we didn’t do anything that requires a lot of
    mathematical knowledge. We started by learning the models from lecture notes,
    playing around data, and reading papers. I like taking notes for the meetings and
    reading over lecture notes. It is nice to write things down on papers physically, and I can
    always refer back. It is a record of my works. </p>

<p> I found eyeballing the data to see if the graph shows a linear or exponential
    relation is a funny way to conduct data analysis (I used desmos for reference on
    linear function and exponential function and highlight segments of the graph on
    iPad – red for exponential, green for linear). It is definitely not the best or
    reliable way to analyze data, but it is a good beginning to understand the data
    that you have better. </p>

<p> One thing that I found inspirational from Monday’s meeting with Prof.Hilfinger
    was that “Sometimes you have to go with the flow, use your intuition to guess
    an approach, and justify it later”. For homework and assignments in courses,
    everything is perfectly planned with flawless simulations, so we can easily
    get ideal results that match with the theories by using mathematical or
    statistical tools. This is not the case for real-world problems. You will
    find yourself struggle to find the perfect approach, or justify why you would
    tackle the problem in a certain way. “Lose something while gaining other things”
    (有失必有得), interpolating data to fill out the gaps in samples might increase
    the variability or produce false assumptions of the relationship between the
    datapoints, but we gain equally spaced data to apply fourier transformation on. </p>

<p> There were many googling around this week. When I didn’t know how to do
    something on python, I just googled it and found potential solutions on stack
    overflow. What would I do without google? What was life like without a search
    engine? I could barely recall. </p>

<p> I understand, from these two weeks, that there are still many things that I
    can learn. Time series analysis, power spectrum, auto-correlation… I do enjoy
    data analysis so far, the process of discovering new tools and program them.
    Looking forward to the new adventure next week :)</p>
