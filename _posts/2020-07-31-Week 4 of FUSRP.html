<p>The video recording for our presentation wasn’t prefect, but it was really fun.
    We had few incidents where we forgot to unmute, and waited in an awkward silence.
    This is one of the many hardship with remote research...
</p>

<p>On Friday’s meeting, Prof.Hilfinger pointed out a mistake we made in the plot.
    It’s been recorded already (ops) but it wasn’t a severe mistake.
    This actually explained my confusion on one of the observation from the plot.
</p>

<p>Watching other group’s midterm presentation was challenging. They used many
    mathematical knowledge that I don’t necessarily have, so it was difficult
    to follow and came up with questions. The FAQ session with all the project
    groups ended in an hour. The machine learning related project got asked more
    questions than others; we got one about the interpolation of time series data.
    I explained how we didn’t assume the glucose data has a linear relation with time;
    we connected data points to observe overall patterns. This is doing
    interpolation between the gaps of the recorded data, as the gaps varied
    from 1 or 15 minutes to several hours.
</p>

<p>We are approaching the end of the program. I feel that we barely made any
    progress. Two months is really not sufficient. The project goal is promising,
    but we only initiated like 5% of the big project... Maybe this is the real
    side of scientific research – breakthrough is always difficult and requires
    lots of efforts with chances.
