<p> This week was a busy week. Prof.Hilfinger clarifies our research goals again.
    It is definitely more clear when things are written down as physically-seen words.
    I finally understand that we are trying to find a procedure to characterize individual,
    a fingerprint given one’s glucose data in the hope to provide personalized medicine
    service. To achieve this goal, we need to analyze the given data (box plots,
    autocorrelation, big drop & rise), while finding a control and regulation rule
    that explains how glucose data interacts in one’s body. We also have our midterm
    presentation soon. I found a template and tried to make slides look visually
    attractive. My teammates will be responsible for the intellectually attractive part :D
</p>

<p> We have tried new ways to measure the interpolation error and the device error.
    Another week that I got carried by my research partner...
</p>

<p> I found myself lack motivation
    while working remotely at home; really miss the days where we can go to library
    to study/work with friends. Lots of readings to do for lecture notes...
    The hardest part is to start doing it. Otherwise, I can procrastinate the
    whole day with no efforts :(
