<p> Hi, I am Ruo Ning (Nancy) Qiu, a forth-year undergraduate student at the
    University of Toronto. I am currently pursuing a specialist in Math and its Application
    in Teaching with double minor in Statistics and Computer Science. </p>

<p> Currently, I am exploring my research interests in mathematics and pedagogy,
    (or together as math education). I really enjoy teaching what I have learned
    in mathematics to others and discussing teaching methods with my peers. </p>

<p> In my spare times, I like to fold <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/ruoning99">origami</a> and capture
    memories with <a
            href="https://vsco.co/qrn99"> phone photography</a>. </p>
